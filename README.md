## .htaccess
An .htaccess file is a simple ASCII file that lets the server know what configuration changes to make on a per-directory basis. It is often placed at the root of a director and will affect that particular directory. There are multiple uses for the .htaccess file but for the one located here, it includes hiding the .html extension and forcing your site to use SSL (you must have a SSL certificate configured to work with your site in order for the latter function to work).

Other possible uses for the .htaccess file not included in mine:
- Redirect the user to different page
- Password protect a specific directory
- Block users by IP
- Preventing hot-linking of your images
- Rewrite URLs
- Specify your own Error Documents
